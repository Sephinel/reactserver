# reactserver
Some ReactJS thing for a database

Src has most of the code, the back end is in 3 separate files outside of it.

Package.json is for the front, package-lock.json are different for front and back.

Original name was "react_tunnilla", now simply "ReactApp" so "react_tunnilla" might appear in some files.
